The forest was in danger; a darkness had begun to creep through the woods, wilting flowers and withering trees with its malevolent touch.\n",

Owls took flight, their wings casting shadows like silent warriors; foxes darted through the underbrush, their eyes gleaming with determination; even the trees bent their branches, ready to protect their home.\n",
