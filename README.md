# LitArt- Books to Artistic Covers

For the "Best Books (10k) Multi-Genre Data" project, our primary challenge lies in effectively processing and utilizing the large and varied dataset of book information. The project aims to address several key issues:
●	Comprehensive Data Analysis: The dataset includes a vast array of genres, requiring sophisticated methods to accurately understand and categorize each book based on its content and thematic elements.
●	Summary Generation: The ability to distill lengthy book descriptions into concise summaries poses a significant challenge, requiring advanced natural language processing techniques to capture the core narrative and themes.
●	Creative Cover Generation: The task of generating book covers that are not only visually appealing but also accurately reflect the book's content is a complex creative endeavor. This involves integrating artistic design with an understanding of the book's themes, genre, and tone.
●	Comparison and Evaluation: A crucial part of our project involves comparing the generated book covers with the original ones. This requires developing criteria and methods for effectively evaluating the accuracy, relevance, and aesthetic appeal of the covers.

By tackling these challenges, our project outcome aims to blend technology and art, offering fresh perspectives on how books are summarized and visually represented. This is a steppingstone in the overall text to image hurdles that current generative models face.

Currently this problem is being explored in the creative space for businesses that need quick turnaround for designs on the fly. The traditional process that goes for generating art or any marketing material goes through tedious amounts of changes back and forth between the client and the designer. These notorious changes are the bane of designers working in the commercial sector, making them bow down to the smallest countenances by clients. 

We would be measuring the success of our product by the turnaround time of our model giving the desired output. This time is crucial since a model would not feel exhausted with the continuously requested miniscule changes as compared to a human designer.

With this in mind, our envisioned 'ideal state' is achieved once the issue is resolved, and our model consistently generates accurate imagery for the relevant literature it is presented with.
